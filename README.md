## Features

*   **Add Tasks:** Quickly add new TODO items via an input box (`todo-list.addTodo`).
*   **View & Manage Tasks:** Access your TODO list through a Quick Pick menu (`todo-list.showList`).
    *   Click on a task to toggle its status between pending and done.
    *   Done tasks are marked with `[DONE]` and moved below pending tasks.
    *   An "Add New Task" option is available directly in the list view.
    *   A "Clear All Tasks" option allows you to remove all items after confirmation.
*   **Plain Text Storage:** Your TODO list is saved as plain text in a `.todo` file in your workspace root. You can directly edit this file, and the extension will automatically reload the changes.
*   **Status Bar Integration:** Shows the latest pending task in the status bar. Clicking it opens the TODO list. Shows "All tasks done!" when the list is empty or all tasks are completed.
